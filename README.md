# Apus
﻿  
**Apus is a automated integrated solution designed for large-cohort MS-based proteomics. It encompasses the entire data analysis workflow, from MS data aggregation, parallelized protein identification, and quantification to comprehensive quality control and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. To support this solution, we developed several dedicated software systems:
﻿**  
 
- **ApuPickup** : Automated data aggregation system
- **ApuPioneer** : Parallelized identification system
- **ApuHorizon** : High-Throughput quantification system
- **ApuMonitor** : Automated quality control system
- **ApuInsight** : Bioinformatics analysis system
﻿

**Users can download these software systems and complete data analysis according to the user guide.**
  
﻿**The data for testing has been uploaded to [IPX0013200000](https://www.iprox.cn//page/project.html?id=IPX0013200000).**
