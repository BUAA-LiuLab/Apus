# Apus Description



#### Apus is a comprehensive, all-in-one platform designed for large-cohort MS-based proteomics. It encompasses the entire analytical workflow, from mass spectrometry data aggregation, parallelized protein identification, and quantification to multi-dimensional quality control and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. To support this workflow, we developed several dedicated software modules.
