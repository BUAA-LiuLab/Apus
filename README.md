﻿
#### Apus is a automated integrated solution designed for large-cohort MS-based proteomics. It encompasses the entire analytical workflow, from mass spectrometry data aggregation, parallelized protein identification, and quantification to multi-dimensional quality control and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. To support this workflow, we developed several dedicated software systems:
﻿
- ApuPickup : Automated Data Transfer System
- ApuPioneer : Parallelized Identification System
- ApuHorizon : High-Throughput Quantification System
- ApuMonitor : Automated Multi-Dimensional Quality Control System
- ApuInsight : Bioinformatics Analysis System
﻿
#### Users can download these software system and complete data analysis according to the user manual of each system
﻿
#### The data for testing has been uploaded to [IPX0013200000](https://www.iprox.cn//page/project.html?id=IPX0013200000)
